    "raw": "\n# Building My First AI-Powered Application\n\nAs a software engineer, I've always been fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence to transform how we build applications. In this post, I'll share my experience creating my first AI-powered application using Next.js, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TypeScript.\n\n## The Initial Idea\n\nThe concept was simple: build a tool that could help developers write better documentation. By leveraging GPT-4's natural language processing capabilities, I wanted to create an application that could analyze code and automatically generate comprehensive documentation.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe tech stack I chose included:\n\n- Next.js for the frontend and API routes\n- TypeScript for type safety\n- OpenAI's GPT-4 API for AI capabilities\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\n\n```typescript\ninterface DocumentationRequest {\n  code: string;\n  language: string;\n  style: 'brief' | 'detailed';\n}\n\nasync function generateDocumentation(params: DocumentationRequest) {\n  const completion = await openai.createCompletion({\n    model: \"gpt-4\",\n    prompt: buildPrompt(params),\n    max_tokens: 1000\n  });\n  \n  return completion.choices[0].text;\n}\n```\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n1. AI models require careful prompt engineering\n2. Rate limiting is crucial for API stability\n3. Type safety helps prevent runtime errors\n4. Error handling needs special attention\n\n## What's Next?\n\nI'm planning to expand this project by:\n\n- Adding support for more programming languages\n- Implementing batch processing\n- Creating a VS Code extension\n\nStay tuned for more updates on this journey!
