# Building My First AI-Powered Application

As a software engineer, I've always been fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence to transform how we build applications. In this post, I'll share my experience creating my first AI-powered application using Next.js, OpenAI's GPT-4, and TypeScript.

## The Initial Idea

The concept was simple: build a tool that could help developers write better documentation. By leveraging GPT-4's natural language processing capabilities, I wanted to create an application that could analyze code and automatically generate comprehensive documentation.

## Technical Implementation

The tech stack I chose included:

- Next.js for the frontend and API routes
- TypeScript for type safety
- OpenAI's GPT-4 API for AI capabilities
- Tailwind CSS for styling

```typescript
interface DocumentationRequest {
  code: string;
  language: string;
  style: 'brief' | 'detailed';
}

async function generateDocumentation(params: DocumentationRequest) {
  const completion = await openai.createCompletion({
    model: "gpt-4",
    prompt: buildPrompt(params),
    max_tokens: 1000
  });
  
  return completion.choices[0].text;
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. AI models require careful prompt engineering
2. Rate limiting is crucial for API stability
3. Type safety helps prevent runtime errors
4. Error handling needs special attention

## What's Next?

I'm planning to expand this project by:

- Adding support for more programming languages
- Implementing batch processing
- Creating a VS Code extension

Stay tuned for more updates on this journey!
